#JOINS
#JOINS ARE USED TO MERGE TWO OR MORE TABLES TOGETHER USING A MATCHING COLUMN

#INNER JOIN
-- Take for instance, you have to offer both Python or Web Level 1 
-- while some can offer both at the same time
-- Let's create table for Python and another table for Web

USE ANOTHER;
DROP Table Python;
CREATE TABLE Python(id int primary key auto_increment, student_name char (20));
INSERT INTO Python(student_name) VALUES ('Ire'),('Seun'),('Gbenga'),('Kolade'),('Victoria'),('Ezekiel'),('Ay'),('Fouad'),('Faith'),('Carter');
SELECT * FROM Python;
CREATE TABLE Web(id int primary key auto_increment, student_name char (20));
INSERT INTO Web(student_name) VALUES ('Funmi'),('Seun'),('Gbenga'),('Abike'),('Sola'),('Ezekiel'),('Ay'),('Tola'),('Ife'),('Carter');

-- PERFORMING INNER JOIN ON THESE TABLES

SELECT  p.student_name, w.student_name FROM Python as p INNER JOIN Web as w on p.student_name = w.student_name;

#ANOTHER WAY OF INNER JOIN
SELECT  student_name FROM Python inner join Web using (student_name);

-- from orders as o inner join orders_details as od on o.ordernumber=od.ordernumber inner join
-- products as p on p.product_id =od.product_id group by ordernumber;

#LEFT JOIN RETURNS ALL THE ROWS FROM THE LEFT TABLE AND THE MATCHING ROWS FROM THE RIGHT TABLE
# SYNTAX
-- SELECT <FIELD LIST> FROM TABLE A
--  LEFT JOIN TABLE B ON A.KEY =B.KEY

select p.student_name, w.student_name from Python as p
left join Web as w on p.student_name=w.student_name where w.student_name is not null;

#RIGHT JOINS RETURNS ALL THE ROWS FROM THE RIGHT TABLE AND ONLY RETURNS THE MATCHING ROWS ON THE LEFT

SELECT w.student_name, p.student_name name from Web as w 
right join Python as p on w.student_name =p.student_name where w.student_name is not null;

#RIGHT JOIN RETURNS ALL THE ROWS FROM THE LEFT TABLE AND THE MATCHING ROWS FROM THE RIGHT TABLE
# SYNTAX
-- SELECT <FIELD LIST> FROM TABLE A
--  RIGHT JOIN TABLE B ON A.KEY =B.KEY

#FULL OUTER JOIN
-- THIS RETURNS ALL THE ROWS WHERE THERE IS A MATCH, EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT TABLE
SELECT p.id, p.student_name from Python as p left join Web as w on

union
SELECT w.id, w.student_name from Web as w left join Python as p on

-- SUBQUERRIES IN SQL
-- WHAT ARE SUBQUERRIES?
-- Subquerries jus as the name implies, having querry(ies) inside another querry.
-- This literally means that you are having another command inside your commmand, that is before this operation is done, do another operation 
-- inside it.
select * from customer_data;
-- WHEN DO YOU NEED SUBQUERRIES?
-- You need subquerry when you want to perform an operation that will lead to another operation.
-- Does this makes sense? Yes, it does. Consider a situation when you want to find all students in a school
-- whose score is less than a certain value and you want to put them in another table as failed student
-- You can write a subquerry for this case.

-- THERE ARE FOUR COMMANDS USE IN SUBQUERRY
-- INSERT 
-- UPDATE
-- DELETE
-- SELECT

-- THE SYNTAX

-- SELECT * FROM Employees 
-- WHERE Salary <(SELECT avg(Salary) FROM Employees)

-- There are two querries in SQL, we have the outer querry and the inner querry.  
-- In writing an SQL statement, the inner querry get executed before the outer querry
USE ANOTHER;
SELECT AVG(Salary) as Avg_Sal FROM staff;

Salary < (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM staff);
SELECT * FROM staff where Salary < (SELECT AVG(Salary) from staff);

SELECT * FROM staff WHERE Salary = (SELECT MAX(Salary) from staff);

SELECT COUNT(Name) as total_count  FROM staff WHERE Salary = (SELECT MAX(Salary) from staff);

#INSERT STATEMENT


-- The INSERT STATEMENT uses the data returned from syntax to insert into another table

-- SYNTAX
-- INSERT INTO TableB
-- SELECT * FROM TableA WHERE VALUE OPERATOR(INNER QUERRY)

-- Let's assume that we have an exam records, we want to pick all students' whose score are less than certain value, and put their info in failed table
-- You must first create the table

(SELECT AVG(total) FROM Exams));

#UPDATE STATEMENT
#The update statement can be used in conjuction with subquerry to update either single or multiple column 
#SYNTAX
# UPDATE TABLE SET COLUMN_NAME =NEW_VALUE WHERE OPERATOR VALUE
#(SELECT COLUMN_NAME FROM TABLE NAME) WHERE

#LET'S HAVE A SCENARIO HERE, WE HAVE A COMPANY AND WE WANT TO GIVE STAFFS WHO HAVE STAYED MORE THAN 5 YEARS IN OUR COMPANY INCREASE IN SALARY

select * from cleaned;

#DELETE STATEMENT
#The delete statement can also be used with Subquerry

#SYNTAX
#DELETE FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE OPERATOR VALUE (INNER_QUERRY)
